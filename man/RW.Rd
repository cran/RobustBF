\title{Robust Welch's Two Sample t-Test}
\description{
Performs robust Welch's (RW) two sample t-test to test the equality of means of two long-tailed symmetric (LTS) distributions when the variances are not equal.}
\usage{
RW(y1, y2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{y1}{numeric vector of sample 1}
  \item{y2}{numeric vector of sample 2}
}

\details{
RW test based on adaptive modifed maximum likelihood (AMML) estimators is proposed as a robust alternative to Welch's t-test (Welch, 1938). The test statistic is formulated as follows
\deqn{RW = \frac{({\hat{\mu}_{1}}-{\hat{\mu}_{2}})-(\mu_1-\mu_2)}{\sqrt{(\hat{\sigma}_{1}^2/M_1)+
(\hat{\sigma}_{2}^2/M_2)}}.}

where \eqn{\hat{\mu}_{i}} and \eqn{\hat{\sigma}_{i}} are the AMML estimators of the location and scale parameters (\eqn{i,=1,2}), see e.g. Tiku and Surucu (2009), Donmez (2010).

The null distribution of RW is approximately distributed as Student's t with degrees of freedom
\deqn{df = \frac{((\hat{\sigma}_{1}^2/M_1)+(\hat {\sigma}_{2}^2/M_2))^2}{{(\hat{\sigma}_{1}^2/M_1)^2/(n_1-1)}+{(\hat{\sigma}_{2}^2/M_2)^2/(n_2-1)}}.}
